# ylilauta-userscripts
A collection of Userscripts made for Ylilauta image board. Sorry Sopsy, we hack your code as you expose it to us.

Started at https://ylilauta.org/ohjelmointi/80863118, Ylilauta has now an unofficial community-driven Userscript repo. 

### Installation

1. Install Violentmonkey (https://github.com/Violentmonkey/Violentmonkey)
2. Choose the script file you want from that repo
3. Select the raw button and proceed with installation

### Contributing
You are free to either post your script to that thread and ping me there so I'd add your script there, or even make a pull request yourself.
